Enhancement Ideas
--------------------
DONE support (limited) symlinks and special files

DONE In case of file permission problems add option to ignore or simply log problems.
 DONE for directories
 DONE for files

DONE Sort files by name instead of using asis order.

DONE internationalize text (English only so far)

DONE capture snapshot of a tree including checksums but excluding content to xml
  DONE load captured snapshot
  DONE capture snapshot

INPROGRESS more checksums that just crc32 (for example cryptographic hashes)
  added MD5 content method to FileNode
  added MD5 calculation to FileNode
  added MD5 method to FileSystemFileName, ZipFileNode, MockFileNode  

text CRC32 comparison

tar and tgz format support

INPROGRESS ability to diff changed files
 context diff
 unified diff
 INPROGRESS position to next/previous change
 DONE file drag/drop
 find text in diff output
 user defined text filters (using groovy perhaps?) 

DONE if file in text area doesn't exist, should follow chain up to try and find and existing dir


configurable file/directory ignore rules

DONE manual tree alignment
 DONE can force old of new root
 DONE indicate forced root or scope of comparison via tree renderer
 DONE ability to unforce a root (for example popup menu for forced root node would off "unroot" instead of root)   
 DONE unit tests

DONE build bin and source distribution targets

better text output format

mouse-over (or some other user method) to view file attributes (time, size, ...)
INPROGRESS using popup menu and dialog

Optionally compare file time and permissions.

ability to to compare text files with sort key as an alternative to text diff. could consider delimited files, CSV, etc.

auto-detection of encoding.  This can be a difficult problem. 

Compare of large directory trees can take a long time.  Add progress indicator.
